# Motivation
I have built up a lot of skills and experiences in all my years of programming.  Recently, I have been interviewing for C++ positions and have found that my knowledge of C++ is outdated and insufficient to meet expectations in the current environment.  C++ programmers are now required to know both C++11 and C++14 for greenfield development projects.

Despite the lack of opportunities for me in C++, I have found a new area where programmers are needed; functional programming and Scala.  I failed at my first opportunity in this new field, but because of the need for functional programmers, I quickly found another position where I would be working in Scala.  I didn't want to fail again, so I'm putting my best effort into learning this new programming paradigm.

As I move forward into this new juncture in my career, I have found that Scala is a language that is more abstract than what I was accostumed in C/C++.  Threads, it appeared, seemed to sprout out of thin air and Scala statements that should have appeared to complete never returned data.  I fear that the further I dive into functional programming, the more knowledge I will be losing about Unix/C/C++ and the imperative environment I was familiar with.

I resolve that this will be the repository of my past experience and will contribute as much as I can here.  I envision that this repository will be record of my experience so that if I need to revisit past knowledge, something here should joggle some deep seated gray matter in my head and bring it back to my conscience being.  Kind of similar to the memory clues left by Kay from the Men In Black movie sequel.

If this the contents of this repository also helps someone else, I consider that to be a bonus and earns me more karma points.
